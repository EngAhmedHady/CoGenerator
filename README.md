# CoGenerator Library
Defining measurement positions on a curved wall posed a significant challenge, particularly, curvature of an airfoil or blade profile. To address this issue, a Python script was developed in collaboration with a CAD model, facilitating the precise determination of measurement locations.

The described methodology extends beyond the LDA traverse and can be adapted for various coordinate systems, including CFD domains. It enables the extraction of boundary layer lines for any aerofoil by utilizing the real-world leading edge and trailing edge coordinates within that system. This versatility enhances its applicability across different experimental and computational setups, broadening its utility beyond specific measurement techniques.

In addition to boundary layer extraction, the library includes functions to provide measuring points for vertical lines or even traverses in cascades, further enhancing its flexibility and utility in various aerodynamic studies.
